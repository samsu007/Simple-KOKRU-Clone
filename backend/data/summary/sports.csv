Four people were shot directly outside the stadium's third base gate, the DC Police Department confirmed on Twitter. Police told The Washington Post that a man had been shot in the leg and a woman shot in the back, while two others walked into local hospitals for treatment. The Nationals reacted to the confusion by cautioning fans to stay inside the stadium, but later confirmed there had been a shooting and encouraged fans to exit through gates in the outfield. The building was later evacuated, including the press box, while the police blocked off the scene of the crime. Sam Fortier of The Washington Post reports that stadium employees called the incident a drive-by shooting.  The shots appeared partially audible on the MASN broadcast as the Nationals returned to the dugout after the top of the sixth inning: Sounds of gunshots were clearly audible in the park, to the point that several fans could be seen fleeing out of the center field and right field gates in the immediate aftermath.

I am deeply remorseful for my actions on Tuesday night. I behaved in a manner that I am not proud of. I have been dealing with some personal challenges of the last several months, but that is not an excuse for how I acted. The importance of mental and emotional health is extremely real and I vow to get the help I need. I appreciate all of the people who have reached out in support of me and my family, including our community here in Seattle. I'm grateful to have such an amazing wife, family and support system to lean on during this time.  Since Sherman's arrest on Wednesday, information has come out that's helped paint a picture of what Sherman, his wife Ashley, and her family went through leading up to the police's involvement.  A woman who identified herself as Sherman's wife made a 911 call that night, which was obtained by ESPN and ABC News.

Olympic organizers reported Saturday that a resident of the Village has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. They are one of 45 positive cases among Olympic athletes and staff since July 1, but the first overseas visitor in the Village. That's not exactly what you want to see as the rest of the world's elite athletes fly into Tokyo, but positive cases were probably inevitable considering we're talking about thousands of athletes from all over the world with varying levels of vaccinations.  COVID-19 cases are again on the rise around Tokyo, which reported 1,308 new cases Thursday, its highest mark since Jan. 21, per the Associated Press. For 26 straight days, case numbers have been higher than they were one week previously. Organizers tried their best to create a bubble in the Village, requiring athletes to undergo daily COVID-19 tests, wear masks when not sleeping, eating or competing, urging social distancing and limiting them to their accommodations and competition venues.

Meanwhile, Kevin Durant, the face of Team USA, is just chilling in his hotel suite at Aria Resort & Casino. “I’m doing fine, myself,” Durant told Yahoo Sports. “I haven’t really left my room with the health and safety protocols we’re following. Not really watching much [NBA Finals] basketball. I’m just out here to hoop, stay safe and get better. The s*** people are saying doesn’t bother me.

The Los Angeles Angels phenom failed to make it out of the first round of the Home Run Derby, losing a multi-round swing-off to Juan Soto, but he still received $150,000 for participating. According to the Orange County Register's Jeff Fletcher, Ohtani decided to give the money away. Ohtani reportedly distributed checks to around 30 Angels support staffers — including trainers, clubhouse workers and media relations personnel — to thank them for their work Friday. What's more, the 27-year-old reportedly planned to do this no matter how the Derby played out, which means he would have been giving out $1 million had he won Monday. Ohtani entered the Derby as the betting favorite, having hit 33 first-half home runs to become the No. 1 seed, but only mustered 22 home runs in the first round to tie Soto. A one-minute swing-off kept the count tied at 28, leading to a three-swing tiebreaker that Soto won.

Oh, they answered questions about their own exploits too, of course, how much of an honor it was to be named to a first or fifth or eighth All-Star team. They picked tacos or tamales, weighed in on what it means to “bat around” (my vote: nine plate appearances in one inning). But whether they’re teammates, regular rivals, or were seeing him in person for the first time at Coors Field this week, everyone was asked about the living legend in their midst. “Where is he now? Wherever the big crowd is,” reigning AL Cy Young winner Shane Bieber quipped during the mad rush of media day. But Ohtani wasn’t among the rest of the All-Star players. After he had been voted into the game as a designated hitter by fans, the players had picked him to be an All-Star pitcher as well.
