Is this the dreaded vaccine-resistant wave that will put economies back into lockdown? So far, at least, that doesn’t appear so – while this variant has shown the ability to infect people who are fully vaccinated, the vaccines have also shown efficacy in preventing serious illness, even from the Delta variant. What we’re looking at is an increase in cases, but a decrease in serious hospitalizations. Taking cognizance of data from the Mayo Clinic, more than 48% of the US population has been fully vaccinated; so, the Delta variant may slow us down, but it will not bring everything to a halt. That’s the view of Jan Hatzius, chief economist from Goldman Sachs. In a new research note, Hatzius concluded, “We think the near-term economic impact of a virus resurgence in the U.S. would be modest.” Backing his stance optimistic stance, Hatzius notes several factors. Important among them are the widespread vaccinations, particularly among the more vulnerable elderly, which are working against further restriction policies. And looking at overall consumer activity – and the general public reaction to the current situation – Hatzius states, “Measures of consumer activity in the U.K., such as spending and mobility, have declined only modestly over the past several weeks, and surveys suggest that U.S. consumers have not meaningfully increased their avoidance of riskier activities. High-frequency measures of consumer spending and restaurant bookings in the U.S. have","– The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 521 points, or 1.7%, to close at 24,521 on Friday, the biggest single-day percentage drop since the financial crisis.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-declines-opec-agrees-boost-222337974.html,Oil Leads Market Plunge as Virus Rattles Faith in Recovery," (Bloomberg) -- Oil was the biggest loser in a broad market selloff after OPEC+ agreed to boost crude supply as a resurgent virus shook investor confidence in the global economic recovery. Futures in New York fell 7.5% on Monday, the largest decline since September. OPEC and its allies agreed to monthly supply hikes of 400,000 barrels a day. At the same time, the spread of the delta variant is stoking a risk-off mood in broader markets and threatening oil demand with fresh mobility restrictions around the world. The dollar also rose, reducing the appeal of commodities priced in the currency. “The demand story has really taken a big hit here, and on the supply side, we’re getting more barrels of crude,” said Ed Moya, senior markets analyst at Oanda Corp. “The momentum behind this move could get ugly.” Oil prices have been volatile over the last two weeks while OPEC+ remained in a dispute over adding supplies to the market. The deal was struck this weekend after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reached a compromise on UAE’s demand for a more generous output limit. OPEC+ will now face a “new set of challenges” next year as rival supplies grow, said Toril Bosoni, head of IEA’s oil industry and markets division, in an email. “As supplies from other producers not part of the deal rebound, and demand falls seasonally, stocks could see renewed builds early in the year,” she said.

A steamroller was used to crush the hardware in the city of Sarawak, after the electric utility company of the Malaysian province accused the mining operators of stealing electricity for their activities. The operators allegedly stole RM8.4 million ($2-million) worth of energy from the company. Authorities say the operation was scattered across four locations and six suspects have been arrested, between the ages of 24 and 64. The police chief of Sarawak says mining operations are becoming rampant in the city, and three houses have burned down as a result of illegal electric connections. Malaysian officials believe that electricity worth $21.3 million has been stolen by illegal Bitcoin mining operations over the past year in the country. Elsewhere in the world, the Security Service of Ukraine busted a crypto mining operation earlier this month for allegedly stealing electricity from the country's power grid. More than five-thousand devices, including racks of PS4 Pros, were confiscated from a warehouse. Ukranian officials say about $256-thousand worth of energy was stolen.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-signals-end-2-trillion-200000682.html,China Signals End to $2 Trillion U.S. Listings Juggernaut,"(Bloomberg) -- For two decades Chinese tech firms have flocked to the U.S. stock market, drawn by a friendly regulatory environment and a vast pool of capital eager to invest in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Now, the juggernaut behind hundreds of companies worth $2 trillion appears stopped in its tracks. Beijing’s July 10 announcement that almost all businesses trying to go public in another country will require approval from a newly empowered cybersecurity regulator amounts to a death knell for Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S., according to long-time industry watchers. “It’s unlikely there will be any U.S.-listed Chinese companies in five to 10 years, other than perhaps a few big ones with secondary listings,” said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management in Beijing. The clampdown, triggered by Didi Global Inc.’s decision to push ahead with a New York listing despite objections from regulators, is already sending shockwaves through markets. A gauge of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks has dropped 30% from its recent high. For investors in companies that have yet to list, there’s growing uncertainty over when they may get their money back. Wall Street firms are bracing for lucrative underwriting fees to dry up, while Hong Kong is set to benefit as Chinese companies look for alternative -- and politically safer -- venues closer to home. It’s hard to overstate the importance U.S. markets have held for Chinese firms.

Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) also declined 2.7% and in Paris the CAC 40 (^FCHI) was 2.6% down.  Investor confidence has taken a knock despite 'freedom day'.  ""Investors’ confidence in the UK has dropped by 5% in July, when compared to June, a steeper fall than the 2% registered on average for regions around the globe,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  ""The sharply rising Covid infection rates across the country, and concerns about fresh easing of restrictions, is likely to be behind the drop, which is identified in the HL monthly investor confidence survey."" Prime minister Boris Johnson, chancellor Rishi Sunak and the new health secretary Sajid Javid are all self-isolating amid what is being called a 'pingdemic' — a proliferation of notifications telling people to self-isolate due to having been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID.  Meanwhile, nightclubs can reopen for the first time since March 2020 with capacity limits are lifted for all venues and events. “Many of the stocks leading the UK stock market downwards are related to","– The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 284 points, or 1.2%, to 25,414 as the market opened for the day.

Fears about broadly rising coronavirus cases drove the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to their biggest drop in nearly two months, and sent benchmark yields to their largest decline in over 3 months as investors sought shelter from the uncertainty. The Dow's point drop was its worst since October 2020. The darkening mood overshadowed anticipation about retail trading upstart Robinhood, which early Monday filed its prospectus to go public at a valuation of $35 billion. The platform is targeting a $2 billion capital raise, and aims to price the stock within a range of $38 to $42 per share. Jitters over the Delta variant even managed to outweigh market expectations for this week's batch of earnings, which will include industry leaders like Netflix (NFLX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The results will offering a fuller picture of how companies are faring as more parts of the economy reopened in the spring and early summer.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-seen-down-oil-212357517.html,Stocks Slump as Virus Jitters Fuel Rush Into Bonds: Markets Wrap," (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slumped around the world as investors rushed into haven assets after the delta coronavirus variant cast a pall over the economic recovery, while tension between the U.S. and China escalated. In a reversal of the reopening trade that has powered this year’s equity rally, cyclical companies bore the brunt of the rout on Monday. Commodity, financial and industrial shares led losses in the S&P 500, which fell the most in two months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its biggest decline since October, while small caps extended a slide from March’s peak to nearly 10%. After recently plunging to pre-pandemic levels, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, soared. With the risk-off sentiment spreading across global markets, long-term Treasury rates spiraled to their lowest since February -- dragging the yield curve flatter. Ten-year yields tumbled as much 12 basis points to as little as 1.17%. The dollar rose alongside the yen and the Swiss franc. Despite the classic safety trade, gold retreated. Oil sank after OPEC+ agreed to boost supply into 2022. Meantime, Bitcoin’s slide pushed the world’s largest digital currency closer to $30,000. The resurgence of Covid-19 is unsettling global investors, who are considering whether new lockdown restrictions will sap the economic rebound and reverse an equity rally that had driven stocks to a record.
