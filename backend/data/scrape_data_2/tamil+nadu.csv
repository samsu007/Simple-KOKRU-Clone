The Corporation had taken up this lake for rejuvenation and development under the Smart Cities Mission. Officials deployed earthmovers and heavy machinery to demolish Amman Kovil, Bannari Amman Kovil, Angala Parameswari, Karupparayan Kovil, Muneeswaran Kovil and a few other temples, reports The Hindu. In 2020, around 2,400 families were removed from the tank bund after demolishing their houses for encroachment of the lake. They were provided alternative housing in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board projects. The Corporation sources said that the temples were demolished to free the Muthannankulam bund from all encroachments. The task was taken up after relocating the people to avoid law and order issues. The netizens have been outraged against this on social media. A social media user claimed that one of the temples demolished is more than a hundred years old. Another user has questioned the status of over five lakh acres of temple land encroached in Tamil Nadu by government and private parties.

While addressing his party workers on July 14, K Annamalai had said, ""Within the next six months, you will see that we can bring the media under our control. No media can keep projecting false information continuously. All the media would come under his predecessor L Murugan, who is now Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting.""
