https://in.news.yahoo.com/india-seeks-lower-oil-prices-125241751.html,India seeks lower oil prices as high pump prices bite,"By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is in talks with crude producers about securing more affordable oil prices after tax-laden pump prices of gasoline and gasoil surged to record highs in Asia's third-largest economy, adding to inflation. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, ships in over 80% of its oil needs from overseas. ""The government has been taking up the issue, bilaterally with crude oil-producing countries as well as with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for affordable crude prices for consuming countries like India,"" junior oil minister Rameswar Teli told lawmakers in a written reply. India's new oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri recently flagged the issue of high oil prices to Saudi Arabia's oil minister and the chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. Oil prices in the global market this month hit their highest level in more than two years as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, prices fell on Monday after OPEC and other key producing countries agreed on Sunday to increase oil supply from August to cool prices.[O/R] Last year, India raised taxes on sales of gasoil and gasoline, instead of passing on the benefits of lower oil prices to consumers, to boost revenue to fund welfare schemes. India's federal government collected about 3.35 trillion rupees ($44.90 billion) by way of excise duty from gasoline and gasoil sales in the last fiscal year to March 2021 compared to 1.78 trillion rupees in 2019/20, Teli said. ""The excise"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-backed-lenskart-raises-220-000000772.html,SoftBank-Backed Lenskart Raises $220 Million as India Tech Booms," (Bloomberg) -- India’s Lenskart, an online retailer for eyewear, raised $220 million from investors including Temasek Holdings Pte and Falcon Edge Capital, in another sign of booming interest in the country’s technology startups. Founded by Peyush Bansal in 2010, the company sells eyeglasses, contact lenses and sunglasses online and through about 750 retail outlets in the country. It plans to use the capital, along with $95 million raised earlier this year from KKR & Co., to expand online sales and add brick-and-mortar stores in India, as well as in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. “Every vertical from apparel to footwear, aside from eyewear, has been disrupted globally,” said Bansal, 37, on a video call announcing the funding. “We can easily spend two decades solving the problem of awareness, penetration and affordability in eyewear.” The startup’s valuation is now $2.5 billion, the founder said. Bansal graduated from Montreal’s McGill University and then worked at Microsoft Corp. in the U.S., before returning to India about a decade-and-a-half ago to become an entrepreneur. He set up Lenskart Solutions Pvt, as the company is officially known, in the dusty, industrial town of Faridabad outside New Delhi and won early backing from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. Lenskart sold about 8 million pairs of eyewear last year and is aiming to grow that by 30% in the year ending March 2022. The company claims to be the largest eyewear seller in India and seeks to become the leader in the new geographies of Southeast"

Nine suicide bombers, belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat linked to ISIS, carried out a series of blasts that tore through three Catholic churches and as many luxury hotels in Sri Lanka, killing over 270 people and injuring more than 500 people on April 21, 2019. Speaking in Parliament, Wickremesinghe said that Harin Fernando, a minister of his government at that time, had informed him after the attacks that Fernando’s father had warned his sister not to attend the Easter Sunday mass as there could be trouble on that day. “When the police did not act on Indian intelligence, would they have acted on Harin Fernando’s information,” Wickremesinghe said as he blamed the police for not acting upon the intelligence provided by India on the impending suicide bomb attacks in the island nation. Last week, head of the Catholic church Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith urged the government to take action against Wickremesinghe for his failure as the then prime minister to prevent the attacks. The Cardinal said that a presidential inquiry on the attacks initiated by then president Maithripala Sirisena had found him guilty for his failure to prevent the attacks. Similarly, the inquiry faulted Wickremesinghe for his soft attitude towards the rising Islamic extremism"
