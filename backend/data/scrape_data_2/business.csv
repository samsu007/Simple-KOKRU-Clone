When Yahoo offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in 2006, Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't know what to do with the money, according to a new book about the social-media giant. Facebook board members and advisors told Zuckerberg he could walk away with half of the $1 billion offer and do whatever he wanted, The New York Times journalists Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang write in their new book, ""An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook's Battle for Domination,"" which came out Tuesday. But one month after Yahoo's offer, Zuckerberg told Facebook's board member Peter Thiel and the venture capitalist Jim Breyer that he wouldn't know what he'd do with the money — and that if he accepted, he'd probably just create another social-media platform similar to Facebook, according to the book. On top of this, Zuckerberg thought Facebook could get much bigger, the book says. Frenkel and Kang conducted more than 1,000 hours of interviews with Facebook executives, current and former employees,"

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Monday, July 19, 2021 Optimism about the U.S. economy is abundant right now. Consumers haven't been this confident in their prospects since the pandemic began. And for the country's biggest businesses, of course, it doesn't take a look much beyond the performance of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the  tightening of credit spreads to see how strong businesses conditions are today.  And when executives like JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon are saying the ""pump is primed"" for consumers to start spending, you know how he's feeling about the state of the economic recovery.  But recent data also shows there's confidence all across the spectrum, for businesses big and small.  Published on Monday, JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Business Leaders Outlook survey revealed that 88% of business leaders surveyed by the bank are optimistic about their firm's prospects over the next six months, the most on record for the 11-year-old survey.  ""After enduring the challenges of the last year and a half, businesses are feeling overwhelmingly positive about what's ahead,” said Jim Glassman, head economist at JPMorgan Chase commercial banking. The survey covered 1,375 business leaders from middle-market companies, or those with annual revenues between $20 million-$500 million.  The bank's survey also shows that three-quarters of respondents are optimistic about both the national and their local economies, up 40 percentage points from last year.  Meanwhile,"

Yahoo Inc is in advanced talks to exit its joint venture in Japan with Softbank Corp, a move that could lead it to focus on reaching a decision on its China assets.  REUTERS/Toru Hanai  TOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - SoftBank's internet business Z Holdings Corp (4689.T) said on Monday it has agreed to pay 178.5 billion yen ($1.61 billion) to secure the rights to Yahoo branding and technology in perpetuity in Japan. In contrast to the retreat of Yahoo in the United States, the brand remains a core part of SoftBank's domestic internet business where the name adorns a web portal and services like shopping and weather. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is offloading media businesses including Yahoo and AOL to private equity firm Apollo Global (APO.N) after struggling to compete with internet giants in a $5 billion deal set to close in the second half of this year. The Yahoo Japan transaction will go into effect after the Apollo deal closes. Previously known as Yahoo Japan, SoftBank's internet business rebranded as Z Holdings and is betting on services such as payments app PayPay and chat app Line for growth in Japan and Southeast Asia.
