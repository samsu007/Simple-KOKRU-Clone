(NASDAQ:ADBE) May Be Fully Valued but Analyst Estimates Are Trending Higher," This article originally appeared on Simply Wall St News The share price of Adobe Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADBE ) rose 23% in the second quarter, making it the second best performing large cap tech stock.

Adobe reported revenue of $3.84 billion for the quarter, up 23% from a year ago and $110 million ahead of consensus estimates. Adobe's largest business segment, Digital Media, increased revenue by 25% to $2.79 billion. The Digital Experience segment grew revenue 21% to $938 million. When the largest segment is growing at a higher rate than total revenue, top line revenue growth accelerates for the company. Adjusted net income was also up 23% to $1.46 billion. EPS of $3.03 were well ahead of consensus estimates of $2.82. The company's management team also raised guidance for the third quarter to sales of $3.88 billion and EPS of $3. After such a strong move it’s worth looking at the company’s valuation.

We're always reporting on what's new in fashion here at Who What Wear, but also firmly believe that you should also wear whatever you choose, regardless of what's deemed ""hot"" at the moment. That's why we took to the members of our fashion team to ask despite what's trending right now, what are the trends they're leaning more towards because lets be honest—some just don't have staying power and may not be worth the investment for you and your style.

https://news.yahoo.com/insiders-explain-responsible-writing-twitters-204320893.html,Insiders explain what it's like to be responsible for writing Twitter's trending descriptions,"Twitter began assigning descriptions to some trending terms in September 2020. These descriptions are written by humans, who dive into conversations and synthesize them. The descriptions - and the people behind them - have been distilled into a ""Descriptions Man"" meme. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. On March 14, ""aaron burr"" was trending on Twitter. Why were a flurry of users on the platform engaging in discussion about the third vice-president of the United States almost 200 years after his death? It wasn't because of ""Hamilton,"" the musical in which Burr is the primary antagonist. It wasn't even for any particular historical anniversary either. The real answer was more complicated. The discussion was summed up in a Twitter-penned description attached to the trending topic: ""The Wikipedia page for the third vice president of the United States, Aaron Burr, has been altered to include a reference to a piece of fan art depicting Thomas Jefferson wearing a chest binder depicting the face of Hatsune Miku."" Providing context to Twitter trends - even ones as complex as this, which invokes one of the most Tumblr-famous pieces of fan art of all time - is the primary responsibility of Twitter's trends curation team, which is staffed by teams in New York, London, and Sydney. Since Twitter's public launch 15 years ago this week, trends have become a crucial part of the social media platform's ecosystem. Twitter first introduced trends in 2008, according to a 2010 blog post from the company. Today trends"

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-trending-lower-possible-break-112608306.html,Bitcoin Trending Lower With Possible Break of $30K Support," Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a month-long downtrend as traders experienced choppy conditions over the past few days. A break below $30,000 is likely given the loss of upside momentum and strong resistance on the charts. The cryptocurrency was trading around $31,000 at press time and is down about 5% over the past week. The 50-period moving average on the four-hour chart is sloping downwards, which indicates a declining trend over the past month. Immediate resistance is seen around $32,000 and $34,000, which could limit upside if buyers return at support. The relative strength index (RSI) is not yet oversold on the four-hour and daily charts. This means sellers are in control as buyers await lower support levels. If $30,000 is broken, the next level of support is seen around $27,000, which is a 60% retracement from the March 2020 price low. Bitcoin’s current sideways trading is similar to the June-November 2018 range between $5,900 and $7,400, which preceded further selling as the bear market advanced.
