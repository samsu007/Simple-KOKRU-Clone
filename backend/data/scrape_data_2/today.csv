https://news.yahoo.com/trump-reportedly-lot-executive-time-141522396.html,Trump reportedly has a lot of executive time on his hands," Former President Donald Trump's post-presidential daily routine sounds a lot like the one he had while living in the White House, an excerpt from Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker's upcoming book I Alone Can Fix It suggests. Back when Trump was in office, he was known for starting his official day later in the morning around 11 a.m. Before that hour, Axios reported in 2018, he would mostly be alone in his residence watching television and scrolling through Twitter. After a few meetings, he would usually head back to the residence around 6 p.m. for some phone calls and turn on the news again. Nowadays, Trump reportedly still gets swept away by the 24-hour news cycle and spends his mornings at Mar-a-Lago in his ""private quarters watching television and making private phone calls to allies and friends,"" Leonnig and Rucker report (there's no Twitte these days, however). Trump will often then go play a round of golf at one of his clubs in the area. He was well-known for hitting the links as commander-in-chief, reportedly spending 307 days on a course during his term. After golf, Trump reportedly later puts on a suit and applies makeup in the afternoon before heading out to meet with politicians or operatives who have made the trip to Palm Beach to meet with him. As Leonnig and Rucker put it, "" by early 2021, Trump had turned his club into a political base camp for his potential comeback,"" though he didn't tell the"

https://news.yahoo.com/mike-mullen-joint-chiefs-mark-milley-coup-trump-173956238.html,Ex-Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen: 'Incredibly disturbing' that military leadership reportedly feared Trump coup," Retired Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that it was “incredibly disturbing” that reports detailed a top U.S. general’s fears that Donald Trump, in the waning days of his presidency, would attempt to use the military to stage a coup or take action against Iran. “I think the reporting, from what I understand, has been pretty accurate,” Mullen said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” according to the show transcript. “Particularly after the election and the two threats that you talked about,” he told host John Dickerson when asked about the reports. “The external one, and whether or not we would commence some kind of combat or conflict with Iran. And then the internal one in terms of where it might go, particularly with respect to how the military would be used by President Trump to somehow validate that the election actually was a fraud and keep the president in power. I think that’s all very accurate and obviously incredibly disturbing, literally in every respect.” The current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, had bluntly described his concern that Trump would use America’s armed forces to overturn the 2020 election, according to excerpts released of an upcoming book, “I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump’s Catastrophic Final Year,” by Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker. “They may try, but they’re not going to f***ing succeed,” Milley told his deputies of a possible coup,"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-signals-end-2-trillion-200000682.html,China Signals End to $2 Trillion U.S. Listings Juggernaut,"(Bloomberg) -- For two decades Chinese tech firms have flocked to the U.S. stock market, drawn by a friendly regulatory environment and a vast pool of capital eager to invest in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Now, the juggernaut behind hundreds of companies worth $2 trillion appears stopped in its tracks. Beijing’s July 10 announcement that almost all businesses trying to go public in another country will require approval from a newly empowered cybersecurity regulator amounts to a death knell for Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S., according to long-time industry watchers. “It’s unlikely there will be any U.S.-listed Chinese companies in five to 10 years, other than perhaps a few big ones with secondary listings,” said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management in Beijing. The clampdown, triggered by Didi Global Inc.’s decision to push ahead with a New York listing despite objections from regulators, is already sending shockwaves through markets. A gauge of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks has dropped 30% from its recent high. For investors in companies that have yet to list, there’s growing uncertainty over when they may get their money back. Wall Street firms are bracing for lucrative underwriting fees to dry up, while Hong Kong is set to benefit as Chinese companies look for alternative -- and politically safer -- venues closer to home. It’s hard to overstate the importance U.S. markets have held for Chinese firms. The first wave began selling American depositary receipts -- surrogate securities that"

Every week, the Tulsa Police Department posts on Facebook about its ""Most Wanted"" person of the week. Authorities were asking the public to help locate Lorraine Graves after detectives suspected she was involved in the killing of Eric Graves, 30, on March 13. Two other suspects were arrested and charged with murder, but Tulsa police were unsure of Graves' whereabouts and asked anyone with information to call Tulsa Crime Stoppers. Turns out authorities didn't have to search too far. Less than three hours after the post, Graves commented: “What’s where’s the reward money at.” On Friday, the Tulsa Police Department announced on Facebook that Graves was arrested in north Tulsa by the fugitive warrants unit. In the post, authorities shared the comments Graves made in the original post. Graves has been charged with accessory to murder. Her bond was set at $500,000.

Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) also declined 2.7% and in Paris the CAC 40 (^FCHI) was 2.6% down.  Investor confidence has taken a knock despite 'freedom day'.  ""Investors’ confidence in the UK has dropped by 5% in July, when compared to June, a steeper fall than the 2% registered on average for regions around the globe,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  ""The sharply rising Covid infection rates across the country, and concerns about fresh easing of restrictions, is likely to be behind the drop, which is identified in the HL monthly investor confidence survey."" Prime minister Boris Johnson, chancellor Rishi Sunak and the new health secretary Sajid Javid are all self-isolating amid what is being called a 'pingdemic' — a proliferation of notifications telling people to self-isolate due to having been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID.  Meanwhile, nightclubs can reopen for the first time since March 2020 with capacity limits are lifted for all venues and events. “Many of the stocks leading the UK stock market downwards are related to"

Fears about broadly rising coronavirus cases drove the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to their biggest drop in nearly two months, and sent benchmark yields to their largest decline in over 3 months as investors sought shelter from the uncertainty. The Dow's point drop was its worst since October 2020. The darkening mood overshadowed anticipation about retail trading upstart Robinhood, which early Monday filed its prospectus to go public at a valuation of $35 billion. The platform is targeting a $2 billion capital raise, and aims to price the stock within a range of $38 to $42 per share. Jitters over the Delta variant even managed to outweigh market expectations for this week's batch of earnings, which will include industry leaders like Netflix (NFLX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The results will offering a fuller picture of how companies are faring as more parts of the economy reopened in the spring and early summer. According to data from Bank of America, second quarter earnings per share are tracking 3.5% above consensus, led by financials, with raised guidance and better-than-expected topline results also strong. According to Citi Global Wealth’s David Bailin, rising coronavirus cases driven will impact industrials ""not not very much."" However, ""When it comes to leisure and services, a significant amount."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-seen-down-oil-212357517.html,Stocks Slump as Virus Jitters Fuel Rush Into Bonds: Markets Wrap," (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slumped around the world as investors rushed into haven assets after the delta coronavirus variant cast a pall over the economic recovery, while tension between the U.S. and China escalated. In a reversal of the reopening trade that has powered this year’s equity rally, cyclical companies bore the brunt of the rout on Monday. Commodity, financial and industrial shares led losses in the S&P 500, which fell the most in two months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its biggest decline since October, while small caps extended a slide from March’s peak to nearly 10%. After recently plunging to pre-pandemic levels, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, soared. With the risk-off sentiment spreading across global markets, long-term Treasury rates spiraled to their lowest since February -- dragging the yield curve flatter. Ten-year yields tumbled as much 12 basis points to as little as 1.17%. The dollar rose alongside the yen and the Swiss franc. Despite the classic safety trade, gold retreated. Oil sank after OPEC+ agreed to boost supply into 2022. Meantime, Bitcoin’s slide pushed the world’s largest digital currency closer to $30,000. The resurgence of Covid-19 is unsettling global investors, who are considering whether new lockdown restrictions will sap the economic rebound and reverse an equity rally that had driven stocks to a record. Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, told Bloomberg Television that the move to “higher-quality assets” such as Treasuries is justified. Americans should avoid traveling to the U.K."
